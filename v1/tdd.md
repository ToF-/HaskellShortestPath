shortest path in 8 steps:

- finding adjacent nodes of a node in a weighed graph
- finding the path from departure to arrival in a table of distances from departure
- using a Partially Sorted Queue
- creating the initial distances PSQ
- extracting minimum from a PSQ
- updating the PSQ with new distance - case of the line path
- updating the PSQ with several new distances - case of the diamond path
- reducing the PSQ
- done
